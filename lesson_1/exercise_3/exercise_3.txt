3. What is the bug in each one of the programs:

Program A:
int main(){
int x, y = 0;
printf("x / y = %d\n", x / y);
return 0;
}

THE BUG : We are trying to divide a number(doesnt matter if its 0) by zero, this will cause an undefined behavior, a runtime error


Program B:
void main(){
int a, b;
printf("%d + %d = %d\n", a, b, a + b);
return 0;
}
THE BUG : we did declare a&b but we didn't initialize them, when we print them it wiil print whatever it was in the address,
but the actual error is when we try to do any operation on an uninitialized variable it wiil lead to unexpected results or a crash
if we instead make them external instead they will be initialized to 0.
